# bootstrap-reliability-assessment-of-functional-connectivity

An innovative approach to bootstrap discovery and replication group samples (N = half sample size in each group) to create the **reliability** map of functional connectivity results. They were then compared to another level of bootstrapping by shuffling subject-level brain data that creates null distribution to find the significance level of reliability. 

Generic scripts that can be applied to time-series or any concatenated 3D data. Analyses were done mostly in Python.
